title: Integration with Memory Component

---

Integration with `Orchestra\Memory` would allow a persistent storage of ACL metric, this would reduce the need to define ACL on every request.

## Creating a New ACL Instance

	<?php

	Orchestra\Acl::make('acme')->attach(Orchestra\Memory::make());

> Using `attach()` allow the ACL to utilize `Orchestra\Memory` to store the metric so we don't have to define the ACL in every request.

## Migration Example

Since an ACL metric is defined for each extension, it is best to define ACL actions using a migration file.

	<?php

	use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;

	class FooDefineAcl extends Migration
	{
		/**
		 * Run the migrations.
		 *
		 * @return void
		 */
		public function up()
		{
			$role = Orchestra\Model\Role::admin();
			$acl  = Orchestra\Acl::make('acme');

			$actions = array(
				'manage acme',
				'view acme',
			);

			$acl->actions()->attach($actions);
			$acl->roles()->add($role->name);

			$acl->allow($role->name, $actions);
		}

		/**
		 * Reverse the migrations.
		 *
		 * @return void
		 */
		public function down()
		{
			// nothing to do here.
		}
	}
