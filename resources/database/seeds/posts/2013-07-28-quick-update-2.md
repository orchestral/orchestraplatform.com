It's been awhile since I was able to really come up with a good tutorial for Orchestra Platform due to personal commitment (hint: I currently looking for a job). Behind the scene Orchestra Platform has been actively improved and patched. With only less than 2 month [orchestra/foundation](https://packagist.org/packages/orchestra/foundation) is now on [v2.0.12](/docs/2.0/components/foundation/changes/#v2.0.12).

### Releases

It is important that bugfixes are tagged and release as frequent as possible to ensure that you can use Orchestra Platform without any breaking functionality, and I would advice future extension developer to do so. Feel free to read [Using "dev-master" requirement for a live site a bad idea](http://forums.laravel.io/viewtopic.php?id=10948) to why this is critical.

### 2.1 Roadmap

I have also posted the release [Roadmap for 2.1](https://github.com/orchestral/platform/issues/13) and welcome any suggestion or request to be consider for it.
